# SMART-AGRICULTURE

# The webpage layout is completely done. 
# The next job is to integrate the ML Model into the flask. For that we need to convert the model into a model file directly from the google collab or we need to run the model in our local desktop.

# The Demo app.py is the flask file. Here the model integration will be done!!
# For reference check for default_app.py file.!!
